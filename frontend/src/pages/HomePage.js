        <br/>
        <p>Please look at the Readme to learn how to run this locally.</p>
        <p>You may also look at the commits to understand the process of development from scratch to a functional app.</p>
        <p>Not all the commits are impeccable because a lot of debugging was needed to be done at various stages.</p>
        <p>It would've been smarter to utitilize branches in this repo, but time constraints caused me not to.</p>
        <p>I also learned how to deploy this app to MongoCloud, but decided not to include all the files needed for this in the repo.</p>
