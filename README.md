# This project is a practice app created with the help of the tutorials

You can find the tutorials in LinkedIn Learning.

The name of the course is "React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site"
It is found on this url: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-15153869

The code is found from https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-3209140/

This repo is not an absolute copy, but pretty close to the original. It is just for practice after all.

A lot of debugging and fixing has been done during the course of this project. The commit messages will explain this in, hopefully, a clearer way.

Be aware that a few things have changed in Firebase, React, and Node so a few updates to the code from the tutorials have been done.

## This project's main features:

Frontend application using React 

Server with Node.js and Express

Persistence of data is with MongoDB

Authentication is done with Firebase

# List of improvements for the future

1. Possibility to deploy to Google Cloud. The app was deployed, however saving the configuration files into Git is questionable therefore none of them are saved. Some of them should be saved for future reference.
2. Set up the "database-data" directory apart from the repository. Now there are too many untracked chages which annoy me.
3. Allow new users to save their names.
4. When user posts a comment include their name with the post. Exactly like it's done via direct API call.
5. Store the contents of each article in the database.
6. Remove comments used for debugging authentication.
7. Opening an article page has an error, which can be removed, but should not be there.
8. There is an error when commenting upon an article.
