# This project is a practice app created with the help of the tutorials

You can find the tutorials in LinkedIn Learning. 

The code is found from https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-3209140/

This repo is not an absolute copy, but pretty close to the original. It is just for practice after all.

A lot of debugging and fixing has been done during the course of this project. The commit messages will explain this in, hopefully, a clearer way.

## This project's main features:

Frontend is a React app 

Backend is Express

Persistence is with MongoDB
